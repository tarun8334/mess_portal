## Mess Registration Reminder System

This project aims to address the common issue of students forgetting which mess they've registered for. To mitigate this problem, I have developed a portal that enables students to effortlessly select their preferred mess for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner. The system provides timely reminders, sending notifications 30 minutes prior to the scheduled mealtime. These reminders include vital details such as the mess name and the day's menu.

Moreover, I've incorporated a feature that alerts students in the morning if they haven't chosen a mess for the day, ensuring that no student misses out on their meals. Additionally, I offer a client-side interface for mess administrators to communicate important messages to registered students. This includes notifications of any delays in the mess starting time or information about special menu items for the day.

### How to Use

To use the Mess Registration Reminder System, simply create an account and log in. Once logged in, you will be able to select your preferred mess for each mealtime and receive reminders 30 minutes before each meal. If you forget to select a mess for a particular day, you will receive an SMS alert in the morning.
